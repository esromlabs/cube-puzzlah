cube-puzzlah
============

Solves the retched cube puzzle. The one with a string of small cubes (I call a snake) that twists and folds up into a bigger cube.

see a demo here... http://esromlabs.github.io/cube-puzzlah/index.html

Currently it is fixed at a simple 4 by 4 by 4 puzzle but with the addition of a simulation space generator...
larger (more difficult to solve)cubes and snakes could be modeled.
